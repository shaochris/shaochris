Hi, I'm Chris (he/him)--a second year Computer Engineering graduate student:man_student: at New York University and I will be graduating in December 2020. I have created software projects in many different aspects, i.e. Web Apps(Python, JavaScript), Distributed Storage Systems(Java), HTTP server(C++) etc., where I gained a wide range of software development skills. Besides school work, I have internships at two startup companies and currently work on an open-source desktop tool in NYU mLab.
